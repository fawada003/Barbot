# Barbot
In this project I host a local flask webserver on which you can create and order Drinks, that are then mixed by a robot.

Obvously this isn't a tutorial as my code is not perfect and needs editing in some places. 
Please note, that this is basically my very first python program so it is obvious that my code has flaws and isnt very clean so please leave only constructive advise.
