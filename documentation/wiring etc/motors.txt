Setup 

raspberry pi, a4988 in extension board (if you dont use extension board you need 100pF capacitor)

A4988:

-Dont forget to adjust the current when using a4988: https://ardufocus.com/howto/a4988-motor-current-tuning/

-Dont foget that A4988 has an enable pin, set it to LOW to enable the motor, HIGH will disable it 

-using a driver board can be practical because you have an inbuild capacitor, easier wiring, better mounting
