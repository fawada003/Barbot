# Barbot
In this project I host a local flask webserver on which you can create and order Drinks, that are then mixed by a robot.

Obvously this isn't a tutorial as my code is not perfect and needs editing in some places. 
Please note, that this is basically my very first python program so it is obvious that my code has flaws and isnt very clean so please leave only constructive advise.

It uses a flask  SQLAlchemy  to host a website on which you can create/delete ingredients then create/delete drinks with those ingredients. In a position Manager you can tell the program where you place ingredients in you rack. When you order a drink, a seperate python program that calculates the steps needed to get the carriage to the bottle and then activates the dispenser to collect all ingredients needed in the right amount. 

I started a documentation but honestly didn't invest much time in it but if you have any questions feel free to dm me.
